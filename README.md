## ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

### 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients using machine learning models. By analyzing medical features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more, the model provides a binary prediction: **0 (No Heart Disease)** or **1 (Has Heart Disease)**.

The implementation is done in a single Jupyter notebook using Python libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
